### Reflections and Comments
* This was a great exercise to walk through the process.
* I feel more comfortable with using prompts in JavaScript, and with styling in CSS.
* It was good to see the process of styling in CSS from scratch when using the reset.css file.
* I can see how long you can spend on styling, really important to keep track of what the goals and objectives are.
